# 🚨 SECURITY ALERT - ACTION REQUIRED

## Issue Detected

Your MongoDB credentials were exposed in the `.idea/runConfigurations/TravnerApplication.xml` file that was committed to GitHub.

**Exposed Information:**

- MongoDB connection details were visible in IDE configuration files

## ✅ Actions Taken

1. **Removed .idea folder** from git tracking
2. **Updated .gitignore** to prevent future .idea commits
3. **Committed security fix** to remove exposed credentials from repository

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. Change Your MongoDB Password (CRITICAL)

```bash
# Log into MongoDB Atlas Dashboard:
# 1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com/
# 2. Navigate to Database Access
# 3. Find your database user
# 4. Click "Edit" and change the password
# 5. Update your server environment variables
```

### 2. Update Your Server Configuration

- Set MONGODB_URI environment variable on your server
- Ensure the new password is used in production
- Do not include credentials in any configuration files

### 3. Verify Security

```bash
# Ensure environment variables are properly configured
# Check that sensitive data is not in any tracked files
git log --oneline | head -5
```

## 📋 Best Practices Going Forward

### Environment Variable Management

- ✅ Use environment variables in production
- ❌ Never hardcode credentials in code or config files
- ❌ Never commit sensitive data to version control

### IDE Configuration Security

- ✅ Keep `.idea/` in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Use environment variables in run configurations
- ✅ Share only template files without sensitive data

### MongoDB Security

- ✅ Use strong, unique passwords
- ✅ Regularly rotate credentials
- ✅ Enable IP whitelisting in MongoDB Atlas
- ✅ Use database-specific users with minimal permissions

## 🔍 Additional Security Checks

### Check for Other Exposed Secrets

```bash
# Search for potential secrets in your codebase
grep -r "mongodb+srv://" . --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "password.*=" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude="*.md"
grep -r "secret.*=" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude="*.md"
```

### Verify GitHub Repository

1. Check your GitHub repository to ensure the credentials are no longer visible
2. Ensure all environment variables are properly configured on your server

## 📞 Need Help?

If you need assistance with any of these steps:

1. Change your MongoDB password FIRST (this is critical)
2. Configure environment variables on your server
3. Verify no sensitive data remains in the repository

**Remember: Security is not optional - treat exposed credentials as compromised immediately.**
