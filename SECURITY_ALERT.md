# 🚨 SECURITY ALERT - ACTION REQUIRED

## Issue Detected
Your MongoDB credentials were exposed in the `.idea/runConfigurations/TravnerApplication.xml` file that was committed to GitHub.

**Exposed Credentials:**
- Username: `madnan221314`
- Password: `SA8rldSab9dfdy10`
- MongoDB Cluster: `cluster0.5os88dy.mongodb.net`

## ✅ Actions Taken
1. **Removed .idea folder** from git tracking
2. **Updated .gitignore** to prevent future .idea commits  
3. **Committed security fix** to remove exposed credentials from repository

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### 1. Change Your MongoDB Password (CRITICAL)
```bash
# Log into MongoDB Atlas Dashboard:
# 1. Go to https://cloud.mongodb.com/
# 2. Navigate to Database Access
# 3. Find user "madnan221314"
# 4. Click "Edit" and change the password
# 5. Update your local environment variables
```

### 2. Update Your Local Configuration
```bash
# Copy the example environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your NEW MongoDB credentials
# MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://madnan221314:YOUR_NEW_PASSWORD@cluster0.5os88dy.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

### 3. Update IntelliJ Run Configuration
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA
2. Go to Run > Edit Configurations
3. Select "TravnerApplication"
4. In Environment Variables, remove the hardcoded MONGODB_URI
5. The application will now read from your .env file

### 4. Verify Security
```bash
# Check that .env is not tracked by git
git status
# .env should NOT appear in the output

# Verify .idea is ignored
ls -la .idea/
# This folder should exist locally but not be tracked by git
```

## 📋 Best Practices Going Forward

### Environment Variable Management
- ✅ Use `.env` files for local development
- ✅ Use environment variables in production
- ❌ Never hardcode credentials in code or config files
- ❌ Never commit `.env` files to version control

### IDE Configuration Security
- ✅ Keep `.idea/` in `.gitignore`
- ✅ Use environment variables in run configurations
- ✅ Share only template files (like `.env.example`)

### MongoDB Security
- ✅ Use strong, unique passwords
- ✅ Regularly rotate credentials
- ✅ Enable IP whitelisting in MongoDB Atlas
- ✅ Use database-specific users with minimal permissions

## 🔍 Additional Security Checks

### Check for Other Exposed Secrets
```bash
# Search for potential secrets in your codebase
grep -r "mongodb+srv://" . --exclude-dir=.git
grep -r "password.*=" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude="*.md"
grep -r "secret.*=" . --exclude-dir=.git --exclude="*.md"
```

### Verify GitHub Repository
1. Check your GitHub repository to ensure the credentials are no longer visible
2. If this is a public repository, consider:
   - Making it private temporarily
   - Or accepting that the credentials were exposed and ensure they're changed

## 📞 Need Help?
If you need assistance with any of these steps, please:
1. Change your MongoDB password FIRST (this is critical)
2. Then ask for help with the configuration setup

**Remember: Security is not optional - treat exposed credentials as compromised immediately.**
